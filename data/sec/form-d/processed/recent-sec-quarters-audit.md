Raw ZIP files are in `data/sec/form-d/raw/`.
Extracted TSV folders are in `data/sec/form-d/extracted/`.
Processed JSON files are in `data/sec/form-d/processed/`.

## FEIN Finding

`sec_all_quarters.py` now captures `company.fein` if a FEIN-like column exists,
but the refreshed SEC Form D TSV files do **not** include a FEIN/EIN column.

The `ISSUERS.tsv` header for all four refreshed quarters has 23 columns:

```text
ACCESSIONNUMBER, IS_PRIMARYISSUER_FLAG, ISSUER_SEQ_KEY, CIK, ENTITYNAME,
STREET1, STREET2, CITY, STATEORCOUNTRY, STATEORCOUNTRYDESCRIPTION, ZIPCODE,
ISSUERPHONENUMBER, JURISDICTIONOFINC, ISSUER_PREVIOUSNAME_1,
ISSUER_PREVIOUSNAME_2, ISSUER_PREVIOUSNAME_3, EDGAR_PREVIOUSNAME_1,
EDGAR_PREVIOUSNAME_2, EDGAR_PREVIOUSNAME_3, ENTITYTYPE, ENTITYTYPEOTHERDESC,
YEAROFINC_TIMESPAN_CHOICE, YEAROFINC_VALUE_ENTERED
```

Result:

| Quarter | Rows with `company_name_normalized` | Rows with `fein` |
|---|---:|---:|
| 2025Q2 | 13,325 | 0 |

## Notes for the Refactor

- The refresh generated raw SEC filings, not the filtered startup master dataset.
- `company_name_normalized` is now available for downstream entity resolution.
- FEIN cannot be extracted from these SEC Form D datasets unless another SEC file
  or external source supplies it.
- The high share of `Pooled Investment Fund` rows confirms that filtering still
  needs to run before these records are used as active hiring targets.
