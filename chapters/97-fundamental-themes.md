A textbook teaches one chapter at a time, but it is held together by a few ideas that appear and reappear under different names. This appendix names them. If you remember nothing else from *The Reallocation Engine*, remember these — they are the load-bearing beams, and every chapter is hung on at least one of them.

## 1. Fluency is not correctness

The book's first sentence and its last lesson. A polished artifact — clean code, a confident recommendation, a labeled chart — tells you nothing about whether it is *right*. Fluency is the surface of competence; correctness is a separate property that has to be checked.

*Where it appears:* the thesis of **Chapter 1** (the fluent take-home, the comprehension debt that opens up when you delegate the doing); the danger a skill poses when it "quietly turns into a chat prompt" (**Chapter 14**); the math error that looks reasonable and is wrong (**Chapter 16**).

## 2. The execution/judgment boundary

Work splits into two things AI has pulled apart: *execution* (producing the artifact) and *judgment* (deciding whether it should exist, whether it's right, what it leaves out). AI made execution nearly free and left judgment exactly as expensive. The whole engine exists to automate execution so your scarce attention can go to judgment.

*Where it appears:* defined in **Chapter 1**; made operational as Gru/Minion in **Chapter 16**; implicit every time a chapter ends with "what the machine could not know."

## 3. The verified-data contract

Run the script and read the audit before you prompt; never invent a count, a rate, or a coverage number. This is the rule that lets you trust a filter enough to *skip a real opportunity* on it.

*Where it appears:* stated in **Chapter 3**; enforced in every Act Two chapter (a number comes from a dataset or it doesn't stand); the reason skills must show provenance (**Chapter 14**).

## 4. Data claim vs. model judgment — label everything

For any sentence: could it have been produced by counting records? If yes, it's a data claim and must trace to a source. If no, it's a model judgment and must be *labeled* as one — never dressed as a fact. Fit (**Chapter 11**) and SOC classification (**Chapter 9**) are model judgments the book insists on labeling, because that is exactly where fluency sneaks back in.

## 5. The binding constraint dominates

Weights should reflect *which constraint is most binding for this specific reader.* For an international student, sponsorship — not fit — is the factor most likely to be the invisible reason for a rejection, so it gets the loudest vote (35%). And the clock is a hard constraint, so it isn't a vote at all.

*Where it appears:* the sponsorship weighting and "a perfect-fit application to a non-sponsor scores zero" (**Chapter 11**); the timeline factor of 0 that gates out a role no matter how good (**Chapter 10**).

## 6. Gates versus votes

Some factors are weighted preferences (sponsorship, fit); others are multipliers that can zero the whole score (liveness, timeline). Encoding a hard constraint as a gate rather than a vote is the math telling the truth: a ghost posting or an unbeatable clock isn't a small penalty, it's a disqualification.

*Where it appears:* the composite form in **Chapter 11**; the timeline multiplier in **Chapter 10**; liveness in **Chapter 8**.

## 7. Skip is a first-class action

Not applying is a decision, not a gap. The reallocation principle says effort should follow expected return, so the time a skip saves goes to the channels that actually produce hires (networking, portfolio) — and a healthy search *skips most of what it sees.*

*Where it appears:* the 3-3-2 allocation and the defense of a skip (**Chapter 2**); the ≥50% skip-rate health metric (**Chapter 15**); reallocating the time freed by a timeline-zero or non-sponsor (**Chapters 10, 9**).

## 8. The invisible-but-sponsoring company

Prestige is loud and the public record is quiet, so the record routinely ranks an unknown lab above a famous logo. The book's recurring case — the funded, sponsoring company you've never heard of — is the reward for reading the data instead of the billboards.

*Where it appears:* the funded firms job boards hide (**Chapter 6**); the backwards ranking the sponsorship scorer corrects (**Chapter 7**); the "Google is a great company" sentence the scorer overrules (**Chapter 11**).

## 9. Coverage and its gaps — Unknown is not Avoid

Verified data has holes. A company can sponsor and not appear in the window your data covers, or fail to match because its name is spelled three ways. So "Unknown" means *the record is silent*, not *they won't sponsor* — and you read the coverage number before trusting any absence.

*Where it appears:* entity resolution and the 38% of firms with no inferred domain (**Chapter 6**); the join coverage you check before trusting an Unknown tier (**Chapter 7**); the SOC match you confirm before reading the numbers hung off it (**Chapter 9**).

## 10. "What the machine could not know"

Every chapter ends here, and it is the point of the whole book. The data gives you the *usual* case; the exception lives in knowledge the data never had — a connection, a freeze, a project no keyword caught, a willingness to take a different path. Verified data is a floor that stops you building on fiction, then hands the situated judgment back to you.

*Where it appears:* literally, in every chapter's box; structurally, as the residue the engine is built to leave for the human.

## 11. Auditability is the real safety

A scoring system is dangerous not because it uses math but because the math can be opaque. The safety is not the formula — it's that you can see *why* a score is what it is. The book's scorer states its weights and sources its factors; the cautionary mirror (Eightfold, which learned managers' biases and disclosed nothing) shows the alternative.

*Where it appears:* the Eightfold contrast and "distrust the recommendation, not your confusion" (**Chapter 11**); provenance as the test for trusting a skill (**Chapter 14**); auditing the engine's own math (**Chapter 16**).

## 12. Honesty is a hard rule, not a tactic

Framing presents accurate information strategically; it never fabricates, misrepresents, or denies status when asked. Your search data is private and reviewed before any commit. An engine that optimizes by shading the truth is precisely the failure the book exists to prevent — fluency in the service of a false impression.

*Where it appears:* the disclosure-by-tier rules and the bright line against misrepresentation (**Chapter 12**); the privacy and honesty gates before any real run (**Chapter 16**).

## 13. The conductor and the orchestra

You are not the musician anymore; you are the conductor. The AI executes superhumanly; you decide what the piece means, hear the wrong note before the score confirms it, and hold all the parts toward one intention. Building the engine doesn't remove the judgment — it relocates it.

*Where it appears:* the Gru/Minion build model and the handoff condition (**Chapter 16**); the inversion from 90% execution to 90% judgment (**Chapter 1**).

---

**How to use this appendix.** When a chapter's mechanics blur, come back here and find the theme underneath — the SOC table, the sponsorship weights, and the skip rate are all the *same few ideas* wearing different clothes. The reader who finishes this book has not memorized five components and a dozen scripts. They have learned to distrust fluency, to ground decisions in data, to put the binding constraint in the math, and to keep for themselves the judgment the machine could never reach.

## Note on sources

This appendix synthesizes the chapters; it introduces no new facts. Every statistic, weight, and rule referenced here carries its citation or `[verify]` flag in the chapter where it first appears. The two recurring source debts to resolve before publication: the headline labor-market figures (54% via connections, ~56% AI-skill premium, ghost-job rates, ~7.65% FICA), and the sponsorship tier-set discrepancy (Proven/Likely/Unknown vs. +Avoid). Both are tracked in `CHAPTER-RESEARCH-MAP.md` and TIKTOC Risk 8.
