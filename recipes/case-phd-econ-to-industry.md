# PhD Economist to Industry Transition

## Purpose

Helps PhD economists and quantitative social scientists move into industry by resolving SOC ambiguity, sponsorship evidence, salary floor risk, and industry research fit. The recipe gives the student and a human reviewer enough evidence to decide which job-search actions are worth continuing, which require manual verification, and which should stop before more OPT time is spent.

## Source Inventory

| Source Node | Node Type | Source URL or Path | Human Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pantry source | file | `pantry/[anonymized source — re-attach an anonymized copy]` | Confirm the source exists, is complete, and is allowed to be used before converting claims into implementation requirements. |
| Pantry source | file | `pantry/[anonymized source — re-attach an anonymized copy]` | Confirm the source exists, is complete, and is allowed to be used before converting claims into implementation requirements. |

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Source | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| input_1 | text | Student run envelope or pantry evidence. [TODO: DEFINE] Specify exact field name and accepted format. | Yes |
| input_2 | text | Student run envelope or pantry evidence. [TODO: DEFINE] Specify exact field name and accepted format. | Yes |
| input_3 | text | Student run envelope or pantry evidence. [TODO: DEFINE] Specify exact field name and accepted format. | Yes |

## Phase Gates

1. Source gate: All required source paths are present or explicitly marked with a typed TODO. Test: `test -f "recipes/case-phd-econ-to-industry.md" && rg -n "\[TODO: DEFINE]" "recipes/case-phd-econ-to-industry.md" || true`. Human capacity: [TO].
2. Scope gate: The run declares `sample` mode or an approved live mode before ingest begins. Test: `python3 -m json.tool data/raw/case-phd-econ-to-industry/run-envelope.json`. Human capacity: [PF].
3. Data-shape gate: Every raw and verified JSON output parses before downstream scripts run. Test: `find data/raw/case-phd-econ-to-industry data/verified/case-phd-econ-to-industry -name "*.json" -print -exec python3 -m json.tool {} \;`. Human capacity: [PA].
4. Script-readiness gate: Every step script exists or is represented by a typed development TODO. Test: `test -f scripts/ingest/case-phd-econ-to-industry-ingest-inputs.py || rg --fixed-strings "[TODO: DEV]" "recipes/case-phd-econ-to-industry.md"`. Human capacity: [IJ].
5. Approval gate: Live network calls, external writes, credentials, production databases, emails, dashboards, publishing, or model calls with sensitive data require an approval record. Test: `test -f logs/gate-decisions/case-phd-econ-to-industry-approval.json || rg --fixed-strings "[TODO: APPROVE]" "recipes/case-phd-econ-to-industry.md"`. Human capacity: [EI].
6. Report gate: Agent log and human report are written with the required fields and sections. Test: `test -f logs/case-phd-econ-to-industry-[DATE].json && test -f reports/generated/case-phd-econ-to-industry-[DATE].md`. Human capacity: [TO].

## Output Contract

### Agent output
File: `logs/case-phd-econ-to-industry-[DATE].json`
Fields: workflow, run_id, mode, steps_completed, records_seen, rejects, duplicates, flags, stop_conditions, todo_items, source_files, gate_decisions, generated_at, raw_output_paths, verified_output_paths, report_path.

### Human report
File: `reports/generated/case-phd-econ-to-industry-[DATE].md`
Reader: domain lead or human boss responsible for accepting the `PhD Economist to Industry Transition` run.
Decision enabled: approve the run for the next phase, request source/schema fixes, or block live execution.
Sections: run summary, purpose, source inventory, inputs used, phase-gate results, steps completed, records seen, rejects, duplicates, flags, typed TODOs, human approvals, verified findings, inferred findings, decision recommendation.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if a pantry source file is missing, because the conversion would no longer be traceable to the original submission.
- Stop if the student run envelope is missing timeline, target role, company, or URL fields, because scoring would require guessing.
- Stop if local sponsorship, BLS, or ATS evidence is missing and no [TODO: DATA SOURCE] fallback is documented, because the result would overstate verification.
- Stop if a proposed script is needed for a score and the script does not exist, because that score must remain inferred or manual.
- Stop before live network calls, external writes, immigration/legal guidance, or recruiter-policy conclusions unless the approval gate is passed.

## Existing Recipe Notes Preserved For Implementation

### Known Evidence From Submission

- SOC wage/role data from BLS/O*NET.
- Company H-1B and Form D evidence where local data covers the employer.
- ATS/liveness for industry job postings.
- Research-topic fit evidence from the submitted persistent-homology project, if cited manually.

### Cannot Verify Without More Work

- Cap-exempt employer rules without manual review.
- Federal/multilateral sponsorship coverage unless new curated sources are added.
- Salary negotiation range; the recipe only checks wage-floor risk.

### Original Workflow Notes

- Verify the HTML mode and PDF research project exist.
- Extract the target roles and candidate research evidence.
- Map each role to plausible SOC codes and show wage/cognitive differences.
- Check sponsorship by employer and SOC where available.
- Check Form D only for private/funded employers; do not penalize federal, public, or multilateral employers for missing Form D.
- Run ATS/liveness for current postings.
- Write an industry-transition report with role family, SOC risk, sponsor evidence, and research-positioning notes.
