# Skill: scan -- Verified ATS Discovery

## Executive Summary

Discover ATS providers and job postings using verified local inputs and the
maintained scripts under `scripts/ats/`. Agents use this to collect and verify
posting evidence; humans use the summary to confirm the scan is not being used
as a proxy for sponsorship, role quality, or job worth.

Use this skill when a student wants to find or refresh job postings for known
companies. This is a data collection workflow, not a prompting workflow.

## Required Reads

Read first:

- `skills/_shared.md`
- `scripts/ats/README.md`
- `data/ats/portals.example.yml`
- `data/ats/portals.yml` if it exists
- `data/ats/scan-history.tsv` if it exists
- `skills/RUN_LOG.md`

## Phase Gates

1. **Target gate:** The scan target is explicit: company list, configured
   portal file, or small pasted list.
2. **Local evidence gate:** Check existing `data/ats/` config/history before
   collecting new data.
3. **Stored script gate:** Use `scripts/ats/` and npm commands before any ad hoc
   scanner.
4. **Small-run gate:** Run a small sample before a broad scan.
5. **Verification gate:** Inspect output counts, provider hits, failures, and
   liveness status before using results downstream.
6. **Logging gate:** Log scans that create or update reusable outputs.

## What This Skill Can Verify

This skill can verify:

- whether a company appears to expose Greenhouse, Lever, or Ashby jobs;
- whether a configured portal scan produced new URLs;
- whether a job URL appears in scan history;
- whether a job posting is probably live when liveness tools are run.

This skill cannot verify:

- sponsorship likelihood by itself;
- role quality by itself;
- whether a company is a good target without checking SEC/H-1B and BLS/SOC data.

## Primary Tools

Use the maintained tools under `scripts/ats/`:

```bash
cd scripts/ats
python3 detect_ats.py "Databricks, Inc." "Anthropic" --output ../../data/ats/ats_detection_sample.csv
python3 detect_ats.py --csv ../../data/80-days-to-stay/data/SEC_DOL_H1b_data_mapped.csv --company-column company_name --output ../../data/ats/ats_detection.csv
cd ../..
npm run ats:scan
npm run ats:liveness -- --file data/ats/job-urls.txt
npm run ats:verify
```

If `data/ats/portals.yml` does not exist, copy
`data/ats/portals.example.yml` and edit the copy. Do not edit the example as a
working config.

To use a non-default config, set `REALLOCATION_ENGINE_PORTALS=/path/to/file.yml`
when running `node scripts/ats/scan.mjs`.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the scan target.
   - Company list from the SEC/H-1B mapped CSV.
   - Hand-curated `data/ats/portals.yml`.
   - A small pasted list from the student.

2. Run the smallest useful scan first.
   - Use a few explicit company names or a small newline-delimited file for a sample.
   - Use the provider scanner only after `portals.yml` is configured.
   - Keep large scans out of git unless the output is compact and intentional.

3. Inspect output files.
   - Count rows.
   - Count provider hits.
   - Note empty provider results separately from errors.
   - Record where the output was written.

4. Check liveness when the output will be used for applications or analysis.
   - "ATS detected" means the provider exists.
   - "Live posting" means the posting URL still resolves and appears active.
   - Keep these as separate fields in reports and notes.

5. Deduplicate.
   - Prefer exact URL dedupe.
   - Then company plus normalized role title.
   - Record suspected duplicates instead of deleting uncertain entries.

6. Log the run in `skills/RUN_LOG.md`.

## Output

For a scan, report:

- command run;
- input file or config;
- output file;
- total companies scanned;
- provider hits by platform;
- live URLs checked, if applicable;
- failures and likely causes;
- next test.

## Log Template

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD -- ATS scan

- **Skill:** scan
- **Input:** data/...
- **Command:** `...`
- **Output:** data/...
- **Worked:** ...
- **Did not work:** ...
- **Evidence:** row counts, provider counts, sample URLs
- **Next:** ...
```

## Prompting Rule

Only use LLM judgment after script output has been inspected. The LLM may
summarize patterns, explain likely failure causes, or propose the next test.
It must not invent ATS hits, live jobs, counts, or sponsorship claims.
